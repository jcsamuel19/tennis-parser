## Project Goal

# Design a mini‑language that lets a coach, analyst, or player record every point of a (singles) tennis match in one compact text file and automatically generate an interactive stats dashboard.

# The program will parse the log → build a structured point list → compute match statistics with pandas → output a small HTML report (tables + matplotlib/Plotly charts).
